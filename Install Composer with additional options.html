Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP projects, you can get it from here, https://getcomposer.org/download/
I used to make following steps for installation,

```bash

$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ composer

```
I did notice about command-line options to make it more convenient,

```bash
$ curl -sL https://getcomposer.org/install | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```
It does the trick for me. If it fails in your case, you probably should pass along with superuser permission as well,
```bash
$ curl -sL https://getcomposer.org/install | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```bash
Yay, thatâ€™s it!
